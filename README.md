# altSSSAMlikelihood

# A simulation/estimation procedure to test if a stock assessment model can estimate the catch and proportions-at-age, or catch-at-age under an array of assumed distributions of the observed data

Options for assumed distribution:
1. Multivariate Log Normal (Catch-at-age)
2. Univariate Log normal (Catch) and Multinomial (Proportions-at-age)
3. Univariate Log normal (Catch) and Dirichlet Multinomial (Proportions-at-age)

Wish list for additional distributions:
4. Univariate Log normal (Catch) and Logistic Normal (Proportions-at-age)
5. Univariate Log normal (Catch) and multivariate-Tweedie (Proportions-at-age)
