# altSSSAMlikelihood

# A simple simulation/estimation procedure to check if a stock assessment model can estimate the catch and proportions-at-age, or catch-at-age when the underlying distribution is "correct" or "incorrect."

Options for assumed distribution:
1. Multivariate Log Normal (Catch-at-age)
2. Univariate Log normal (Catch) and Multinomial (Proportions-at-age)
3. Univariate Log normal (Catch) and Dirichlet Multinomial (Proportions-at-age)

Wish list for additional distributions:
4. Univariate Log normal (Catch) and Logistic Normal (Proportions-at-age)
5. Univariate Log normal (Catch) and multivariate-Tweedie (Proportions-at-age)
